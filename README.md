# AvalancheTracker
Here's a project I built to track burned fees per block on Avalanche C-Chain


# Requirements
-Express
-Ejs
-Mongodb
-Nodemon (dev dependency)


# How to use

In home page, the system will display tha latest block informations for Avalanche C-Chain.

Blocks informations are stored into cloud-based MongoDB, but you can use the local installation.
